Decisions that need to be made:
------------------------------

Whether to use forked repositories or a central one

Which people should have admin/commit/merge rights on the central repo?

Whether to use only master as a permanent branch, or to add in maintenance,
release, qa, development or project branches

Whether to use feature branches

Should a single developer be able to do a pull request AND merge it?

Should there be a mandatory code review?
